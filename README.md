# To Do List Manager

## Problem Domain

Part 1 of a 4-Phase build of the To Do List application. In Phase 1, I refactored the application and implemented context API. I also learned how to use Blueprint Component API and styled the application with this. 

## Features 

* Style the application using the Blueprint Component API

* Properly modularize the application into separate components

* Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
