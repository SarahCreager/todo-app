# To Do List Manager

## Problem Domain

Part 2 of a 4-Phase build of the To Do List application. In Phase 1, I refactored the application and implemented context API. I also learned how to use Blueprint Component API and styled the application with this. In Phase 2, I implemented a user preference form where the user can alter the view of the application using context API. I also implemented local storage so the user's preferences are applied automatically on startup.  

## Features 

* Style the application using the Blueprint Component API

* Properly modularize the application into separate components

* Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components

* Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings

* Save the users choices in Local Storage

* Retrieve user preferences from Local Storage and apply them to the application on startup
